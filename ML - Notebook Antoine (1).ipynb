    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing daily variations in electricity futures prices within the European market, specifically for France and Germany. Given the complex interplay of meteorological, energy production, and geopolitical factors impacting price fluctuations, the objective is to build a model that explains these movements rather than predicting exact prices. Leveraging Spearman correlation as the primary evaluation metric, we will employ a range of models—from linear regression benchmarks to advanced machine learning approaches (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost, and RNNs)—to capture both linear and non-linear influences on price variations. This model aims to support energy producers, traders, and policymakers by providing insights to optimize trading strategies, manage risks, and strengthen the resilience of the European energy grid."

This centrality can be interpreted as follows:  \n",

Extreme values might influence the mean and variance, which could affect models sensitive to significant deviations. Techniques for managing outliers (e.g., data transformation or smoothing extreme values) may be necessary to enhance model robustness.  \n",

    "The observations regarding centrality and outliers have several implications for analysis and modeling:  \n",

    "1. **Strategies for managing extreme values**: The outliers in the French data may require special handling, such as outlier removal or the application of normalization or logarithmic transformation techniques to reduce their impact.  \n",
    "2. **Country-specific approaches**: Since the target variable's distribution differs between France and Germany (particularly regarding outliers), it may be advisable to build separate models or apply differentiated preprocessing for each country.  \n",
    "3. **Use of robust models**: In the presence of numerous outliers, more robust models, such as those based on the median (quantile regression) or ensemble algorithms (e.g., random forest or gradient boosting), might be better suited than standard linear models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary  \n",

    "### Spearman's Correlation in Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to explain daily variations in electricity futures prices in Europe. Given the complex and non-linear relationships between factors like energy production, weather conditions, and market prices, **Spearman's correlation** is a suitable tool to evaluate our model's performance, alongside other metrics like R², MAE, and MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Spearman?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monotonicity**: The relationships between variables, such as the impact of gas prices on electricity prices, may be monotonic but non-linear. Spearman captures these monotonic trends where Pearson would fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness to Outliers**: Since the data can contain extreme values (e.g., sudden price spikes), Spearman is less sensitive to outliers, providing a more stable evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capturing Non-linear Relationships**: Variables like renewable energy production or electricity exchanges may have a non-linear effect. Spearman helps measure the monotonic relationship, even if it's not strictly linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spearman's Rank Correlation Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman rank correlation coefficient ($\\rho$) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $d_i$ is the difference between the ranks of corresponding values in the two datasets.\n",
    "- $n$ is the total number of data pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R²**: This metric tells us the proportion of the variance in the target variable (electricity prices) explained by the model. A higher R² indicates a better fit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: This measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, providing insight into how close the model's predictions are to the actual values, with smaller values being preferable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: This gives us the squared average of the model's prediction errors, emphasizing larger errors more heavily. Like MAE, smaller values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's correlation is ideal for our project because it allows us to evaluate complex, non-linear trends in electricity prices while being robust to outliers. Alongside Spearman, we also use R², MAE, and MSE to provide a comprehensive view of our model's performance and ensure it captures the underlying dynamics of the electricity market effectively.\n"

These metrics indicate that the RandomForestRegressor is better equipped to capture underlying patterns, particularly non-linear relationships.
